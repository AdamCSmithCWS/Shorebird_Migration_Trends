# Shorebird_Migration_Trends

Estimate population trends for migrating shorebirds in North America (primarily Eastern North America) using data from International Shorebird Survey, Ontario Shorebird Survey, and the Atlantic Canada Shorebird Survey

Spatially explicit, hierarchical Bayesian model that estimates population trends using a penalized spline (GAM) smoothed population trajectory, similar to [@smith2020].

A paper describing the results from this model is currently in review.

The results from this model, and earlier versions of it, have already been used in a number of conservation applications including the:
