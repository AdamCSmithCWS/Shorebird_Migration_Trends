<h4>Thank you for downloading data through Naturecounts.</h4>

<p>The file you have downloaded (titled BMDE_data.txt) is a text file in CSV format.
This format minimizes the size of your download and allows users to import the data into almost all data
management programs.</p>

<p>To Open the file in Microsoft Excel please follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
<li>save the file on your computer
<li>open Microsoft Excel
<li>choose 'File' <li>'Open' from the menu
<li>navigate to the folder in which the BMDE_data.txt file is saved
<li>change the 'Files of Type' tab at the bottom of the window to display 'All files'
<li>chose the BMDE_data.txt file and click 'Open'
<li>a window will open that will allow you to convert the CSV file to excel format
<li>choose 'delimited' and click next
<li>select 'Tab' and click Next
<li>click Finish
</ul>

<p>You should now have the data in excel format. If you need further instructions or assistance please contact
Catherine Jardine at <a href="mailto:cjardine@birdscanada.org">cjardine@birdscanada.org</a></p>

<p>Please note that Excel 2003 or earlier versions can only open up to 65,000 records. Starting with Excel 2007,
the limit exceeds 1 million rows. If the file exceeds the Excel limitations, you may have to open the text
file in a text editor and create several smaller files, but a better alternative would be to use a program that
can handle larger data files, such as Microsoft Access.</p>
